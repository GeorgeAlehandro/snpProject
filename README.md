# SNP Search Project - WebDev Project - M2 DLAD

## About this project 

This project was done in the purpose of a course project for a web development and database management course at the University of Aix-Marseille M2-DLAD. 

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a website that allows for an interactive search for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms **SNPs** from a database in a Django-based web framework.  
The user should also be able to search for **Phenotypes** (aka. traits) and the SNPs related to each one of them.  
Additionally we provide the user the possibility to search by genes, to plot meaningful figures and to interactively move between the different pages.  
## Homepage
A carousel showcasing the different functionalities of the website, brought to you by Bootstrap.
